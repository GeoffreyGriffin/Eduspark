**Development Setup**

1. **Clone the repository:** `git clone <repository_url>`
2. **Install dependencies:**
   - `cd client`
   - `npm install`
   - `cd ../server`
   - `npm install`
3. **Configure environment variables:**
   - Create a `.env` file in the root directory.
   - Add environment variables (e.g., database connection string, API keys).
4. **Start the development server:**
   - Run `npm start` in both the `client` and `server` directories.

**Testing**

* Implement unit tests for components and server-side logic.
* Consider using testing frameworks like Jest, Mocha, or Cypress.


**Deployment**

* Deploy the frontend to a static hosting service (e.g., Netlify, Vercel).
* Deploy the backend to a cloud platform (e.g., AWS, Google Cloud, Heroku).
* Set up a reverse proxy (e.g., Nginx) to route traffic to the appropriate services.


**Future Enhancements**

* **AI-powered features:** Personalized recommendations, automated grading, and AI-powered tutoring.

* **Virtual Reality/Augmented Reality integration:** Immersive learning experiences.

* **Integration with other educational tools:** LMS, SIS, and other educational platforms.
